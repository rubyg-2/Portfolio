          Project 1: Autonomous Maze-Navigating Robot

</a>
</h3>
       <p>This was a semester-long team project focused on designing, building, coding, testing, and demonstrating an autonomous robot. Working with a team of three other members, we developed a robot capable of navigating a maze to transport a disabled person while adhering to traffic control rules.</p>

<h3>Key Features of the Robot:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Color Sensor:</strong> Used to detect path indicators.</li>
  <li><strong>Red Path Indicator:</strong> The robot stops for a second before continuing.</li>
  <li><strong>Blue Path Indicator:</strong> Switches to manual mode after beeping twice, allowing a teammate to assist with passenger transfer.</li>
  <li><strong>Yellow Path Indicator:</strong> Designated drop-off zone, switching to manual mode for final assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The entire system was programmed and controlled using MATLAB, ensuring seamless autonomous and manual transitions.</p>

  Project 2: Interactive Q&A Application
</a>
 </h3>
    <p>This is an ongoing team project designed to create a user-friendly Q&A platform for students. The platform is built using JavaFX for the GUI and a database to store all user data persistently. The application enables students to ask and answer questions while providing additional features for private messaging, role management, and search functionality.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Users can create an account and log in, ensuring their data is saved even after closing the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Management:</strong> Admins can assign and manage user roles, while also viewing all registered users.</li>
  <li><strong>Q&A Interface:</strong> Students can post, answer, and mark questions as resolved or unresolved.</li>
  <li><strong>Private Messaging:</strong> Users can send private responses to others for direct discussions.</li>
  <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> A built-in search feature allows users to quickly find relevant questions and answers.</li>
</ul>

<p>This application promotes a collaborative learning environment, ensuring students can engage in meaningful discussions while keeping track of their interactions and progress.</p>

        </h3>
        
        <p>This website is dedicated to promoting and encouraging more women to pursue careers in technology. It highlights the gender gap in the industry, discusses its importance, and provides valuable resources for young girls to get involved in tech. Through shared information and accessible opportunities, the goal is to inspire and support the next generation of women in technology. </p>

    Project 4: Book Management System
  </a>
</h3>
        <p>
          The program features a menu-driven interface, enabling users to interact with the system through commands. Users can store, retrieve, update, and delete book records based on input choices.

This program implements a linked-list-based Book Management System in C++. Each book is uniquely identified by its ID, a combination of its title and edition, and stored in alphabetical order.
